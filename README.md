=======

Inspire is a JavaScript framework used to create single page applications hosted on Microsoft SharePoint (2010-2013) site collections. This version is a stripped implementation, isolating the core of the framework which takes advantage of Google's V8 engine. This template provides a starting point for developing a single page application on SharePoint, and defines the suggested directory structure for the framework.
